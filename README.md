# Hangsitu

A JS / D3 implementation of the classic game

## Server Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server.

This example uses the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

[README](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/README.md)

## Local Dev

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

## Additional Tasks

Run unit, api and ui tests (Note: This task will spin up and shut down the server for the api and ui tests)

```
npm test
```

Run unit test code coverage:

```
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

Set up watch for jshint and unit testing:

```
npm run test:unit:watch
```

Run api tests:

```
npm run test:api:local
```

Run api tests (if the server is already running):

```
npm run test:api
```

Run ui tests:

```
npm run test:ui:local
```

Run ui tests (if the server is already running):

```
npm run test:ui
```

Run ui tests with GUI / watch mode (if the server is already running): 

```
